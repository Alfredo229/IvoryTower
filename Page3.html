<h2>Stepping</h2>
<p>Drawing out a system, you would understand how the stepping works. Simple like 3 and 7 -> 3 6 9 12 15 18 21. Stepping is 7 per 3 "big divided per small". In this case, 2 and 1 on 3. 0+2 1/3 -> 7. 7+2 1/3 -> 14</p>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Considering the main factor value (3), and the increment (2 1/3). There would also be a context. (2). Listening to it, on an audio wavelength, You would hear the the value of the context, pretty much. This is why sticking to 5 and 10s only ever, means 2. All of them. Needs a new word though. Assuming you only get the raw stuff, it is possible to determine on a 2 segment system. Very obvious, which can sometimes be useful.</p>
<h2>Triangles</h2>
<p>This is the latest i have. Considering stuff in general, there was the consideration of running 4 and 7 and 11. Which i don't remember why, but a triangle has 3 segments. On a 2 segment system, the relativity is single. On a 3 segments system... Well, you would have to care about the units. Hertz or length. The 2 segments system's values are the same method, the 3rd segments is simply equal to the main factor value. Bit of a problem, i wanted to plug 8 for oxygen. Problem with that is if i set 8 as the 3rd offset and the main factor... I dunno, it plain works? Say 13-8 5. Uh nope. How about 8-9-17? Pretty much i guess. Requires a bit of consideration for the increments and the "context"</p>
