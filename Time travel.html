<h1>Time travel for dummies</h1>
<h2>Basic steps for time travel</h2>
Step 1: Determine the nature of time.<br>
Step 2: Determine a compatible medium.<br>
Step 3: Mathematics.<br>
<h2>The nature of time</h2>
Time is a cycle.<br>
Minutes, hours, weeks, fashion, wars, lives. Circles.<br>
<h2>A compatible medium</h2>
This is where you overkill me.<br>
All i have is a wavelength generator. Audio.<br>
I also play on the FM band. Radio wave is well a wave.<br>
<h2>Mathematics</h2>
Fractions.<br>
Audio is simple enough. For the FM band, you have to get tricky.<br>
A frequency and the offset of, create a beat to the value of the offset.<br>
Huh... Pretty much.<br>
If you play 180hz and 210hz... You get a 30hz rhythm.<br>
So assuming i use 1057 to 885 fm, i get uh a 180ish offset. The FM band has 205 positions from 875 and 1079. (counting the zero). That makes for a lot of offsets.<br>
I like to say, relativity... is a point of view.<br>
A to B is a factor. Bland, simple and dead. What you want is a ratio. Say 9 11 (big duh). 885 to 1057 is 172. That would be your long offset. so you * the long offset by 9/11. And you add/substract to either end.<br>
That is the basics.<br>
<h2>Triangles</h2>
This is what i'm running right now. Considering 6/7 is equal 1-(1/7), well you run a long offset and stick the ratio in the middle.<br>
9/11 would become 172 * (11/20). Offset in the middle.<br>
Bit of an edit here...<br>
What you want here is a ratio. So, if you're going for 4 and 5, you use 4/5 and 1/5.<br>
Multiply either by whatever factor you're using.<br>
<h2>Polarity</h2>
This one is complicated.<br>
You would want to draw the hops. 6 to 29. Mark the 1s at the cycle of 6 to the value of 29.<br>
I'm not drawing it now, but i would assume you would get 5 layers with 6 increments each.<br>
This one is increments.<br>
Decrements would involve 31.<br>
30 is longer than 29. System increments (longer).<br>
30 is shorter than 31. System decrements (shorter).<br>
<h2>Multiple layer relativity</h2>
The units matter. You have the length, seconds. And you have the hertz. BPS.<br>
Mathematics one to the other is "reciprocal". It's on the calculator. 1/x 1/x 1/x.<br>
The unit you want is a length. The unit you're working with is hertz.<br>
This implies the rule of three is off.<br>
Example.<br>
2,3,4.<br>
885-1057=172.<br>
172*2 = X;<br>
X/2 = offset 1;<br>
X/3 = offset 2;<br>
X/4 = offset 3;<br>
And so on and so on and so one.<br>
Do me a favor...<br>
