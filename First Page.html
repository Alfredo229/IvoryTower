<p>The Runes or Futhark are a set of character in the ancient Viking writing. In that time context, writing was uncommon and each letters had an assigned background.
It was not uncommon to use the Runes in a serie of metaphor.</p>
<p>The Runes were used in funeral rites, magical and religious purposses and divination. The computer medium was created in 1969ish.
Multiple computer programs predate that medium, they were running on simple human mind. The Runes is one of those computer programs.
It fell out of use with word writing, but it still works for it's intended purpose.</p>
<p>There's a copy of the current Wiki about President Donald Trump. From what i read it's very respectful and the information is backed by the sources at the bottom.</p>
