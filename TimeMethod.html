<h1>Methods on time travel</h1>
<h2>Polarity</h2>
This one has been popular with the locals, i think.
<br>
There would ba a basic setup, 5 and 10 or 5 and 15... And so on and so on.
<br>
Those have common factors and fall apart. Thing is you notch it by one. making it 5 9 or 5 11.
<br>
The implied 10 is longer than 9 making it a system with more exposure and less density.
<br>
The implied 10 is shorter than 11 making it a system with higher energy and more density.
<br>
The 5 9 system would cause you to build up energy, kinetics or stuff like that. God knows walking is hard here, don't ask.
<br>
The 5 11 system woould bitch slap you into common sense. A higher density system would definitly be more stable and more limited in range or scope.
<br>
Depreiated.
<h2>Cones</h2>
<h3>Aka Interlaced</h3>
Basic layout has 2 nodes and another one in the middle.
<br>
You would select a ratio and apply it to the total length.
<br>
Sounds like fun, but what about the other side of the ratio?
<br>
The polarity method implies a system of 1-2 1-3 ratio. That is bad. I'll get back to this.
<br>
There's no way around thick stuff.
<br>
Drawing 1 to 5, twice.
<br>
1234512345
<br>
Draw all the intervals from 1 to 4. Add the interval offset form one to one.
<br>
123451 x1
<br>
135241 x2
<br>
142531 x3
<br>
154321 x4
<br>
You would notice the sequence is the same as the other one, reversed, on the opposite end.
<br>
So, what side is it really? Both.
<br>
The main problem with the polarity is not it itself. The main problem is the ratio it uses by default. 1 and 2.
<br>
Considering the cones setup, a system of 5 and 6 would imply an additional system of 1 and 6. That is fine and i don't care about all of infinity.
<br>
Except 1 and 2.
<br>
Following the methods it would imply a system of 1 and 1. Which is like any system of like 3 and 3 out of six. What bothers me is the whole absolute implications of one out of one.
<br>
Julia said it best. Everything out of everything is nothing. This here is what worries me. You can't tell everything from everything, there is no landmarks, no way to orient. A fish doesn't know the water it's swimming in.
<h2>
Reversed Average
</h2>
This is a development of the Cone method
<br>
It's a bit overwhelming for a title but it's not as bad as it looks.
<br>
Assuming you only use 2 numbers for cones it doesnt matter.
<br>
Assuming you want to use 3 or more you need a bit of math.
<br>
So fractions. First thing you need is a common denomminator. The sum of all 3 numbers.
<br>
Then you divide your full offset by the common denominator.
<br>
Save to memory, on a calculator.
<br>
Then you would pick either dot of the main segment and add denominator multiplies one of the values you want to use.
<br>
Rinse repeat for the whole list.
<br>
Current favorite is for Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.
<br>
I know, satrun right?
<br>
Then there's the moon... Simple.
<br>
What is actually funny is Venus, Mercury and the moon. There usually is nothing there. If Mercury was still a God, i assume he would be surprised. "Something taller than me?"
<br>
I secretly believe the sun doesn't fit inside the earth, even though it's at the middle.. Of the solar system.
<br>
Instead, the sun would be up in the sky, in the middle of a singularity. Or of an egg where the Earth is layed out on the inside of the egg.
<br>
Lots of funs.
<h2>Interlaced Polarity</h2>
For values of 15 and 5. You get a simple increment of 5, times 3.<br>
For values of 15, 5, and 4. You get a simple increment of 5, times 3. And a sequence of 4 to 15.<br>
The relativity from a sequence to the other is a progression.<br>
Ie: -1 -2 -3 -4... Until it loops at 15, i suppose. Or maybe half?<br>
Probably loops one way or the other. So yeah, probably half.<br>
Drew the whole thing. As per usual the recoil is reciprocating. But the whole sequence is definitly accelerating.<br>
<h2>Interlaced Polarity</h2>
A number of things stopped making sense. It is important to observe the units. So, reversed average is out. I'm going back to the older ones.
