a help and a healing of every one, if they hearken to his demands before.

glistening clear as glass, most like gemstones
a floor created by frost, and a fair face.

to the proud where warriors sit
in the beer-hall, happy together.

with noble men. It is always on its journey

that our wretched flesh be commended to the earth.

although it fights against many men.
