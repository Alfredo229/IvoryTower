<h3>Sublayers</h3>
<p>There is to be: A length. A ticker. And the recoil. The length is the total length of a system. The ticker is the increment, the second parameter. And the recoil is the length of... Nevermind for now.</p>
<h3>Drawing out the length</h3>
<p>You would want to draw the length twice. Then from 1, increment an offset to the value of the ticker. Note the value of the length each time the ticker cycles at one.</p>
<h3>Polarity</h3>
<p>Now, the sequence would increment to the value of the ticker. Over the full cycle of the length.</p>
<p>The sequence would also cycle, inversed, to the value of the recoil.</p>
<p>If there is to be a node at each end of the length, i'm not sure specifically. However if there is a single node and 2 offsets in static, polarity can be determined. By the ticker used and the implied value of the recoil.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Sequence to the length of 11, ticker 9.</p>
<p>Drawing out the length twice: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11</p>
<p>Notch the values of the length to the incremented value of the ticker:</p>
<p>1 10 8 6 4 2 11 9 7 5 3 1</p>
<p>Now, this looks like backwards 2. Which it is. It is also positive 9, it just loops off the length over a long sequence.</p>
<p>The ticker you use determines the polarity.</p>
<p>Pretty much...</p>
