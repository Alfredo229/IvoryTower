<h1>Manual runic reading</h1>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><font size="4">Pull a single rune and read the associated text. This is a question. You have to match it with whatever is real to you: emotions, thoughts, facts, etc... Then you pull another rune and you repeat the process. The message will complexify as you pull more runes, no need to pull all of them.</p>
