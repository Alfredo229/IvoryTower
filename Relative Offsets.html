<h1>Relative Offsets</h1>
<h1>All rights reserved</h1>
<p>A system to the cycles of 6 and 7 has a relative offset of 1. 6 to 7 is 1. 12 to 14 is to. The increment is 1.</p>
<p>A system to the cycles of 5 and 7 has a relative offset of 2. 5 and 7 is 2. 10 to 14 is 4. The increment is 2.</p>
<p>In order ot observe this, draw the increments. 6 12 18... And 7 14 21.</p>
<p>Then, write down the increments. 1 to 6 is 5. 6 to 7 is 1. 7 to 12 is 5.</p>
<p>The sequence is symetric.</p>
<p>Cycle syncronization is at the multiplication of the cycles length. 6 to 7 is 42. 6 sets of 7, or 7 sets of 6.</p>
<p>One can play a frequency to the value of the synchronization. 300-342, or 200-242.</p>
<p>But i don't  think it would scale.</p>

<p>Have a nice day.</p>
